    <p> <span class="pera">In</span>  Germany, block posts are known as Blockstellen (abbreviation: Bk) and are defined as railway facilities
         on the open line that mark the end of a block section, as part of a block system. They usually have a home signal in 
         each direction and on each running line. They are mainly found where the distance between two railway stations is greater
          than average.
